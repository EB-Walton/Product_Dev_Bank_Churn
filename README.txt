Thanks for taking a look at my repository here!

This is my submission for a project in my DATA824 course through University of Kansas. 
What you're looking at is a shiny app doing a quick exploration of bank churn data.

The bank data was found on Kaggle and was created by Bhuvi Ranga. The file and supporting document can be found at the website below:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhuviranga/customer-churn-data

You will find 4 files in this repository:
-This README
-A copy of the bank churn data from Kaggle, downloaded July 21, 2023
-The server.R file for running the shiny app
-The ui.R file for the user interface of the shiny app
